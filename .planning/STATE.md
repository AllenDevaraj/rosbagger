# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-21)

**Core value:** Query and understand the data inside any ROS bag from one command — no one-off scripts, no ROS install.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — scaffold-test-harness

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Universal reader via `rosbags` (no ROS dependency for offline modules)
- DuckDB default query backend behind a swappable `QueryBackend` seam
- Flatten messages to dotted, quoted columns; alias pack deferred
- v1 = `rosbagger-core` + `bagq` only; tf/record/replay/gui/edit/events are later milestones
- [Phase 01]: Workspace root kept virtual (no [project] table); intra-workspace dep via [tool.uv.sources] workspace=true
- [Phase 01]: rich is the single table-output dependency (ships via typer); tabulate dropped
- [Phase 01]: Dev interpreter pinned to 3.10 (the floor) via .python-version
- [Phase 01]: uv.lock commit deferred to plan 01-02 (file-ownership split); 01-01 owns manifests + sources only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GSD planning agents (`gsd-project-researcher`, `gsd-research-synthesizer`, `gsd-roadmapper`) not installed — roadmap was generated inline; post-phase verifier/nyquist auditors disabled. Install via `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest --global` to enable.
- GitHub push pending auth (no `gh`, no credential helper); `origin` set to https://github.com/AllenDevaraj/rosbagger.git.
